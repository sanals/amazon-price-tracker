# Logging and Monitoring
# Priority: Combined Rules
logging_and_monitoring:
  logging_framework: Use SLF4J with Logback (default in Spring Boot).
  log_levels:
    configuration: Configure log levels appropriately in `application.yml`. See `configuration.yml`.
    recommendation: INFO for production, DEBUG for development.
  log_content:
    guidelines: Log meaningful information, especially at ERROR and WARN levels. Include context (e.g., user ID, product URL) where helpful.
    security: Avoid logging sensitive information (passwords, tokens, personal data).
  monitoring_actuator:
    usage: Use Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring.
    endpoints: Expose relevant endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/metrics`). Configure exposure in `application.yml`.
  external_monitoring:
    status: Future/Production consideration.

    tools: Integrate with external monitoring systems (Prometheus/Grafana, ELK stack) for comprehensive observability.
